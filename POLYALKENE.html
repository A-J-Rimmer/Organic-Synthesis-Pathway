<h3>Required Information:</h3>
<p>PVC:</p>
<p>Polyvinylchloride is the trade name of poly(chloroethene). PVC can be modified using plasticisers, which are small molecules that separate the polymer chains, allowing them to slide over eachother. This makes the PVC more flexible and able to be used in clothing, electrical insulation etc. whilst untreated PVC is more rigid and better suited to applications such as drainpipes and window frames.</p>
    <br><p>METHODS OF DISPOSAL:</p>
    <p><em>Landfill- </em>Polymers are typically disposed of by putting them into landfill- however, most alkene-based polymers are too unreactive to be broken down by biological processes. This causes them to take up space in landfill sites, and pose a threat to wildlife. </p>
<p><em>Combustion- </em>Waste polymers can be burnt, providing a source of energy. However, this produces greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, and the presence of other additives may also cause the formation of hazardous products.</p>
<p><em>Mechanical Recycling- </em>This method involves collecting plastics of the same type, and melting them so that they can be remoulded into other objects. This method helps to conserve fossil fuels, reduces the amount of space in landfill occupied by polymers, and reduces harm to ecosystems. However, it requires the polymers to be manually sorted- without this sorting, the mixture of melted plastics is not suitable for re-use.</p>
<p><em>Feedstock Recycling- </em>Feedstock recycling also helps to conserve resources etc., but involves converting polymers back into their constituent monomers. This method does not require the sorting or washing of the plastics, but does carry a large energy requirement.</p>
