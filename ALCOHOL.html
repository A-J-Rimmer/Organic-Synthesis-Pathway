<h3>Required Information:</h3>
<p>PHYSICAL PROPERTIES:</p>
<p><em>Melting/Boiling Points:</em> Alcohols have higher melting and boiling points than alkanes with the same number of carbon atoms, as the -OH groups cause hydrogen bonding to occur.</p>
<p><em>Solubility:</em> The -OH group allows short-chain alcohols to dissolve in water- however, the carbon chain is non-polar (and therefore insoluble), and so as the length of the chain increases, the more it inhibits dissolution, and hence solubility decreases.</p>
<br><p>ETHANOL AS A BIOFUEL:</p>
<p> Glucose can be broken down by enzymes (e.g. zymase) in yeast into ethanol. This glucose comes from carbohydrates in crops such as sugar cane/beet. This reaction is an example of anaerobic respiration:</p>
<p>C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub> &#8594; 2C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH + 2CO<sub>2</sub></p>
<p>The resulting mixture is ~15% ethanol, (as the enzymes cannot function at higher concentrations) which can be separated via fractional distillation and used as a biofuel.</p>
<p>Ethanol can also be made via the hydration of ethene from crude oil. This method is faster, can occur continuously, and gives a purer product. However, crude oil is a non-renewable source, and when oil reserves are depleted, it may become more economical to make ethanol by the fermentation of sugars.</p>
<br><p>OXIDATION:</p>
<p>Tertiary alcohols are not easily oxidised, as this requires a C-C bond to break (rather than a C-H bond). However, primary and secondary alcohols can be oxidised via potassium dichromate (K<sub>2</sub>Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>) and sulphuric acid (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>).</p>

<p>*No further oxidation occurs at this stage, for the same reason as tertiary alcohols.</p>
